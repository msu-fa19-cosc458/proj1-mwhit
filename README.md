##  Welcome to the world of Kehlani!!

The theme/focus of this project is my favorite artist Kehlani. I started listening to music about 3 years ago, and Kehlani was the first artist that stuck. Her music has become such a huge part of my life, and I saw no better way to show that than by making this project about her!


To complete this project, Genius and Twitter API were used to pull data about songs and tweets that people write about Kehlani. The Genius search was a lot easier than the Twitter, I simply had to search "Kehlani". For Twitter, I had to specify "kehlanimusic" because of some recent news about her personal life.


####  Problems:
 1. Heroku/Github did not like me. I struggled for 5 hours to get heroku up and running. The issue ended up having to do with my repo, and with a quick quick switch and a few edits, it was up and running!
 2. A lot of my problems ended up being typos. In the Procfile I had "wed" instead of "web". It took a few hours to realize, but after CAREFULLY combing through my files, I was able to iron out of lot of my bugs.
 3. I had some issues getting the indexing right for pulling random songs and tweets. This took some trial and error to find what were the perfect max index that I could use. After awhile I was successfully able to find the max, and the pages loaded without any error!
 4. The styling of my page is not the best. I've never been good with making things look more appealing. In the future, I will try to dedicate some time to work on visuals!
